            <P>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they
			run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.
				Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year
				1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz 
				Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible
				to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly
				adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted 
				in Western Europe and other parts of the world.</P>

            <P>A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1] Motorcycle 
			design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including 
			racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle
			club and attending motorcycle rallies.The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany 
			was the first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series 
			production motorcycle.
			In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), and Hero
			MotoCorp (India).[4] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy.
			Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.</P>

<div class ="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4"><H4 id="three">CYCLE</H4>
            <P>Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged 
			in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[2] "bicyclists",[3] or "bikers".[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling" also includes
			the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).Bicycles were introduced in the 
			19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.
				Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances.
			Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking,
			increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or 
			noise pollution, and much reduced traffic congestion. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).
			By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.</P>
